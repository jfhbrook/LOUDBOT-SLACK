LOUDBOT-SLACK
=============

LOUDBOT FOR [SLACK.COM](https://slack.com/) AND [GAMER SLACK](https://discord.com)
CHAT IS NOW KEEPING IT REALTIME.

I STOLE [ISAACS](https://github.com/isaacs)'S LOUDBOT AND TURNED IT INTO THIS. AT LEAST I DIDN'T USE PROMISES.

RUN THIS SOMEWHERE AND GIVE IT A SLACK AND/OR DISCORD API TOKEN IN THE SLACK_API_TOKEN AND/OR DISCORD_API_TOKEN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE(S). YOU CAN PUT THAT INTO `.env` IF YOU LIKE OR SUPPLY IT ANY OTHER WAY YOU SEE FIT. YOU WILL NEED TO DEPLOY THIS IN A DIRECTORY WHERE IT HAS WRITE PERMISSIONS BECAUSE IT WANTS TO LEARN FROM YOUR SHOUTING.
